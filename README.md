# Cross-Stitch Pattern Generator (TFM – Master in AI Development)

## Project Overview
This project is the Final Master Project (TFM) for the Master in AI Development.

It is a web application for cross-stitch enthusiasts that allows users to:
- Convert images into cross-stitch patterns
- Calculate fabric size and floss requirements
- Manage embroidery projects
- Export printable patterns (PDF)

The project follows a Clean Architecture (light) approach and uses AI as a copilot
throughout the development lifecycle under strict human supervision.

## Goals
- Deliver a real, deployable application
- Apply clean architecture principles pragmatically
- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Demonstrate responsible AI-assisted development
